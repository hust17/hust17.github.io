We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. 
Format: Submissions are limited to 10 pages in the ACM format 
(see http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). 
The 10-page limit includes figures, tables, and your appendices, 
but does not include references, for which there is no page limit. 
Papers should be submitted in PDF format. The margins and font sizes 
should not be modified. We kindly refer authors to the necessary templates [2].

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair
website [3].  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Proceedings will be published in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital
library through collaboration with ACM SIGHPC.
